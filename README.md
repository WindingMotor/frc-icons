### A VS Code Extension that adds fun little themed icons.

FRC Icons is designed to enhance your coding experience by adding a collection of, red themed icons to your Visual Studio Code environment. The themeing of this icon pack is heavily based off my home team of 2106.

## Features
- **Themed Icons**: A variety of icons themed around FRC, enhancing the visual appeal of your project files.
- **Java and Kotlin Support**: Tailored icons for both Java and Kotlin files, ensuring a consistent and recognizable coding environment.
- **Easy Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with your existing VS Code setup, requiring minimal configuration.

## Getting Started
To get started with FRC Icons, simply install the extension from the Visual Studio Code Marketplace or download the VSIX package.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you have ideas for new icons or improvements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Please match the themeing of the other icons though!
All files used for creating the icons are in the main-svg.svg file with Inkscape 1.3 support.
